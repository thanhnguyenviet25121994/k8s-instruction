Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join master-node:6443 --token y2no52.drumml955u7gnb7t \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:c258871287986703177a5b2351bc34f83d74cbe9fa815d9bd19a5fea6f556940 \
	--control-plane --certificate-key e3898da43e3b926cb985e489be8ac9589105d3cd7358b41eb28a70b33225f174

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join master-node:6443 --token y2no52.drumml955u7gnb7t \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:c258871287986703177a5b2351bc34f83d74cbe9fa815d9bd19a5fea6f556940
